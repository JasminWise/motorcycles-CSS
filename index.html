    <h2><span class="italic">Why</span> should you buy one?</h2>
    <article><h4>Most people think that motorcycles can be dangerous but most of the time it's cars that cause the death of motorcyclists. Others migth say it's dangerous and that you shouldn't buy one, who cares we only live once so if you want to buy a motorcycle then buy one. Most motorcycles are cheaper than a car unless you're getting a 987 C3 4V Vyrus or a Conventry Eagle. Beginner bikes are around 5,000-6,000 dollars which isn't that much but you <span class="strong">must</span> wear gear even if it's hot. You will meet pretty chill people who ride bikes and one of them might even become your best friend or lover. Buy what will make you happy even if it won't make others happy and if this is what will make you happy then get the bike.</h4></article>
